 A dummy application following the MVC pattern with Ember.js

 It can be used as skeleton to develop more complex apps.

 I created this app as a proof of concept to test a REST
 client using ember-data that connects to a REST server
 provided by Django Tastypie. This app is mainly useful
 to test the DjangoTastypieAdapter.
